# Rules for Reporting Issues

* Earlier versions than **Kodi Matrix** are no longer supported.
* Please provide **FULL** details of your issue.

  ```
  Operating System: Android/Windows/OSX, etc...
  Device: Nvidia Shield/FireTV, etc...
  Version of Kodi: 19.0/19.1, etc...
  Version of Umbrella add-on: 6.3.0/6.4.9, etc...
  Country: USA/Australia/UK, etc..
  Debrid services in use: Real-Debrid/Premiumize/AllDebrid.
  ```
  What not to do:

      DO NOT state things like "no streams available" when searching
      How am I to test without knowing the "season" and "episode" you are having an issue with?
  What is best practice:

      Post screenshots of the issue!
      The more detail you can provide of the condition, without me asking for additional info,  the faster I can trace it.


* **ALL** error related Issues opened **MUST** include log files. Please provide both the **Kodi debug** log as well as the **Umbrella** log file.
* Please review Open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.

* If I've requested additional info for your issue it is your job to monitor the issue. I'll delete posts after an extended period of no response.

* If your issue is service related outside of Umbrella, please wait at least **24hrs** before opening an issue. Services go down for maintenance and I do not desire to spend my time chasing this to respond back to you with **Real-Debrid is down for maintenance**.
* Please learn to cross check the meta providers before posting an issue.  Posting things like **episodes missing** from **Brooklyn Nine Nine** when **TVDb** shows an additional episode for Season 8 and **TMDb** does not is counter productive.  **Umbrella** indexes the meta from **TMDb** so what they offer is what we will see.  I cannot, and will not manipluate this provided meta in any form of a workaround.
* I do not have the luxury of free time to devote playing Kodi teacher.  If you do not understand how to post a log, cross check gui meta vs. meta provider sites, find a specific setting category, understand basic Kodi terminolgy..like you do not know the difference between the terms "scrape" vs. "search" then you need to google search and do some reading first.
