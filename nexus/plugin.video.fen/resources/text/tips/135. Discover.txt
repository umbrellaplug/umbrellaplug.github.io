Discover is a feature that allows you to browse and/or export lists that you make yourself using the filter values you provide. Only the filters you wish to use need to be assigned a value, the rest can be left blank. Once you've set your desired filters, select 'Save & Browse Results' if you want to simply start looking through the list you have made, or 'Export Search' to place your new list in one of the Fen Main Menus (Root, Movies or TV Shows). Clear your filters to start again by selecting 'CLEAR FILTERS'. Your lists can be re-viewed by navigating into 'DISCOVER: History'.
