To enable Extra Fanart, and start displaying banners, clearart and keyart within your skin (where supported by skin), turn on 'Include Extra Art' in the "Metadata" settings tab of Fen.
Also, to have Posters and Fanart supplied by fanart.tv, rather than TMDb, turn on "Use as Default Provider" in the same settings section.
