The [B]<reuselanguageinvoker>[/B] element is a feature introduced with Kodi 18.0 that changes the way
the python invoker works in Kodi trying to reuse the invoker instances as much as possible. As a
result, the addon performance is greatly improved. Please note that instability issues may occur
due to reported bugs in this new implementation.  Test on your own!!!
