## FAQ

**Q:** Why do you have a seperate scraper package?

**A:** At some point there may be a shared scraper package, but you would get the same results with every addon for searches. I will continue to maintain my own package so tweaks and modifications can be made for now. It also gives you the ability to set different scraper settings for different addons. I feel that is currently the best way.

**Q:** Why should I use this instead of Venom?

**A:** Venom has been retired. Respect the developer and let it go. 123Venom was an amazing developer, I chose this addon to clone because I used it and it worked well. If you don't want to use this plugin, don't. Please don't waste my time or yours with comparisons to Venom, I won't waste my time justifying why you should use an addon I maintain for free.



**Q:** Do you take feature requests?

**A:** Of course, open an issue.



**Q:** What's the difference between this and Ezra?

**A:** Ezra is a clone of Fen. This project is a clone of Venom. They use different code completely. I would run both.



**Q:** Are you going to do a clone of Fen also?

**A:** NOPE. Ezra is doing a fine job.
