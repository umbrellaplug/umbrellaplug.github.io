Go to Settings->Results->Results Color Highlights and choose firstly your desired setting for "Highlight Results Based On".

* SCRAPER TYPE - Highlight results based on the type of result i.e. one color for hoster results, one color for torrent results etc.
* PROVIDER - Highlight results based on the provider the result is for i.e. one color for Easynews, one color for Real-debrid etc.
* QUALITY - Highlight results based on the quality of the result i.e. one color for 4K, one color for 1080P etc.

As you change the setting above, relevant color settings will be shown for you to set as desired.
